Easy Opus Internal Operations and Mobile Number Registration
To create a seamless experience in Easy Opus, which is bound to a user's mobile number and integrates with external calendar services like Microsoft Outlook (.ics), iCal, Google Calendar, and Office 365, the backend system needs a robust, highly secure, and scalable setup. Here’s an in-depth look at how Easy Opus accomplishes this:

1. Binding the Mobile Number to the Easy Opus Mobile Application
User Registration and Mobile Number Verification
    1. User Onboarding and Verification:
        ◦ During initial registration, the mobile number is the unique identifier for each user.
        ◦ Amazon Cognito (or similar identity services) is used for registration and verification, where an OTP (One-Time Passcode) is sent to the user’s mobile number. This OTP is verified before the mobile number is bound to the Easy Opus account.
    2. Mobile Number as a Primary Identifier:
        ◦ The mobile number is stored as the primary key in the user database. This approach ensures that all user data (calendar entries, settings, and preferences) are indexed by the mobile number, allowing quick access to the data for syncing or updates.
        ◦ The mobile number also enables session tracking and ensures that notifications or updates are directed to the correct device.
    3. Data Encryption and Security:
        ◦ All user data associated with the mobile number is encrypted in Amazon DynamoDB (for scalable, fast access) and Amazon S3 (for media storage), ensuring data security and privacy. AWS KMS (Key Management Service) can be used for managing encryption keys.
Persistent User Sessions:
    • A session token or JWT (JSON Web Token) is issued after login and bound to the mobile number, which allows secure session management and API access for updates and calendar syncing.

2. Real-Time In-App Updates and Synchronization with External Calendars
a. In-App Calendar Updates with Real-Time Sync
    1. Direct Sync using AWS AppSync or WebSockets:
        ◦ AWS AppSync (GraphQL) or AWS API Gateway with WebSockets enables real-time updates to the mobile app. When a user adds or updates an event on Easy Opus, the app communicates with the backend over a persistent WebSocket connection to receive updates instantly.
        ◦ This ensures users receive immediate feedback on changes made to events, notes, or reminders associated with the calendar.
    2. Server-Side Event Handling:
        ◦ AWS Lambda functions listen to changes in DynamoDB or events triggered from the mobile app. When an update occurs, such as a new event or reminder, the Lambda function processes the data and initiates updates to any external calendars (e.g., Google, Office 365).
b. Synchronizing with Microsoft Outlook (.ics), iCal, Google Calendar, and Office 365
    1. Calendar Data Transformation and Storage:
        ◦ Events created within Easy Opus are stored in a standardized calendar format (e.g., iCalendar format (.ics)) in DynamoDB, which is compatible with other calendar services.
        ◦ Each event record in DynamoDB includes metadata like:
            ▪ event_id
            ▪ start_time, end_time
            ▪ title, location, description
            ▪ sync_status for tracking updates with external services.
    2. External Calendar Integration (Google, iCal, Office 365):
        ◦ For each connected calendar service, Easy Opus maintains OAuth tokens (securely stored and managed in AWS Secrets Manager or Cognito).
        ◦ Using these tokens, Lambda functions connect with each service’s respective API to sync events:
            ▪ Google Calendar API: Used for creating, updating, and deleting events directly on the user’s Google Calendar.
            ▪ Microsoft Graph API (for Office 365): For syncing with Office 365, the Microsoft Graph API is used to read and write calendar events.
            ▪ iCal and .ics files: When syncing with iCal or Outlook, an .ics file is generated for the calendar event. The file is then either pushed directly to the client or provided via a URL for one-time download, which iCal-compatible clients (e.g., Apple Calendar) can subscribe to.
    3. Real-Time and Periodic Sync Management:
        ◦ Real-time sync is achieved by triggering updates as soon as an event is modified. AWS Lambda functions serve as the backend processes that execute these syncs.
        ◦ For Google Calendar and Office 365, webhooks or polling mechanisms ensure any changes made on the external calendar (like a change on Google Calendar) are fetched back to Easy Opus.
        ◦ Periodic Sync: In cases where real-time syncing isn’t possible, a scheduled Lambda function periodically checks for updates across all integrated calendars and syncs them back to Easy Opus.
    4. Conflict Resolution:
        ◦ Easy Opus employs a versioning system (or timestamping) to resolve conflicts between external calendar events and in-app modifications.
        ◦ When there is a conflict, the user is prompted to review changes, or the most recent change can overwrite previous data (based on user preferences).
    5. Notifications and Reminders:
        ◦ Using Amazon SNS (Simple Notification Service) or Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM), Easy Opus sends reminders or updates about upcoming events directly to the user’s mobile device.
        ◦ These notifications are bound to the mobile number, ensuring they reach the correct device even if the user has multiple mobile devices or calendar integrations.

3. Scalability and Performance Management
    1. Handling Millions of Transactions:
        ◦ DynamoDB with Auto-Scaling: DynamoDB is configured with auto-scaling for handling spikes in read/write operations, ensuring that even with millions of calendar events or updates, performance remains high.
        ◦ Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service) and Lambda Concurrency: For large-scale data processing and updating external calendar services, SQS queues events, and Lambda functions process them asynchronously. This ensures reliable handling of large numbers of updates.
    2. Caching:
        ◦ Amazon ElastiCache (Redis) can be used to cache frequently accessed data, such as recurring events or reminders, reducing the load on DynamoDB and minimizing response times for mobile users.

Example Workflow: Adding an Event in Easy Opus and Syncing with Google Calendar
    1. Event Creation:
        ◦ A user creates an event in the Easy Opus mobile app. The app sends the event details to the backend API along with the mobile number.
    2. Event Storage:
        ◦ The event is stored in DynamoDB, tagged with the user’s mobile number and marked for syncing.
    3. Google Calendar Sync:
        ◦ A Lambda function picks up the event and, using the user’s stored OAuth token, pushes the event to Google Calendar via the Google Calendar API.
    4. Real-Time Update on Mobile Device:
        ◦ Once synced, the mobile app receives a real-time update via WebSockets, confirming that the event is now on Google Calendar.
    5. Notification for Upcoming Event:
        ◦ At the set reminder time, an Amazon SNS notification is sent to the user’s mobile number, alerting them of the upcoming event.

This architecture ensures that Easy Opus provides a seamless experience, with calendar updates accurately synced across the mobile app and external calendar clients, while managing high transaction volumes and maintaining real-time notifications. The mobile number acts as the unique identifier, enabling reliable data handling, secure access, and accurate notification delivery.
       Workflow examples
To ensure Easy Opus provides a unified calendar view that seamlessly syncs across Google Calendar, Office 365, Apple Calendar, and its own native calendar service, we need well-defined workflows for each integration. Each workflow allows Easy Opus to aggregate events from external calendars and push updates back to them when needed, creating a single interface where users can view, add, and manage all their calendar events in one place.

Workflow 1: Google Calendar Integration
User Workflow for Syncing Events with Google Calendar
    1. Login & Authorization:
        ◦ When the user connects Google Calendar, Easy Opus uses OAuth 2.0 to request permission to access the Google Calendar API. The user is redirected to Google for authentication.
        ◦ After successful login, an OAuth token is saved and securely stored in the Easy Opus backend, allowing Easy Opus to read and modify calendar events without repeated logins.
    2. Initial Sync:
        ◦ API Call to Google Calendar: Once authorized, Easy Opus calls the Google Calendar API to pull all events associated with the user’s account.
        ◦ Database Update: Events are stored in the Easy Opus database under the user's mobile number, with a unique identifier from Google Calendar to prevent duplicate entries.
    3. Ongoing Synchronization:
        ◦ Real-Time Pulling: Easy Opus uses Google Calendar push notifications to receive real-time updates. When the user makes a change in Google Calendar, Google sends a webhook notification to Easy Opus, which then pulls the latest event data and updates the unified calendar view.
        ◦ Two-Way Syncing: When the user makes changes in Easy Opus, the app sends an API call to Google Calendar to update or create the event. This ensures that the data is consistent in both Easy Opus and Google Calendar.
    4. Unified View:
        ◦ Events from Google Calendar appear alongside events from other calendars (like Office 365 and Apple Calendar) in a single view within the Easy Opus app.

Workflow 2: Office 365 Calendar Integration
User Workflow for Syncing Events with Office 365 Calendar
    1. Authorization with Office 365:
        ◦ The user is prompted to authenticate via OAuth 2.0 with Office 365, granting Easy Opus permissions to access and manage calendar data.
        ◦ An OAuth token is generated and stored securely, enabling Easy Opus to access Office 365 calendar data on the user’s behalf.
    2. Initial Sync of Office 365 Events:
        ◦ API Call to Office 365: Easy Opus retrieves all calendar events from Office 365 using the Microsoft Graph API.
        ◦ Events are stored in Easy Opus with identifiers to avoid duplication, and metadata is saved to distinguish Office 365 events.
    3. Real-Time Sync and Updates:
        ◦ Polling or Webhooks: Easy Opus can use the Microsoft Graph API’s webhook notifications or polling methods to detect changes in Office 365 calendar events.
        ◦ Two-Way Syncing: Changes made in Easy Opus are reflected in Office 365. This is managed by sending updates to Office 365 through the Microsoft Graph API whenever an event is created, modified, or deleted in Easy Opus.
    4. Unified Display:
        ◦ Events from Office 365 are shown together with those from Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, and Easy Opus’s native calendar in a consolidated view.

Workflow 3: Easy Opus Native Calendar Service
User Workflow for Managing Events in Easy Opus’s Native Calendar
    1. Event Creation:
        ◦ The user creates an event directly in the Easy Opus calendar, which is saved in Easy Opus’s native database, tagged with the mobile number.
    2. Multi-Calendar Syncing:
        ◦ Push to External Calendars: When an event is created in the Easy Opus calendar, the app sends the event details to Google Calendar, Office 365, and Apple Calendar APIs if the user has linked these accounts.
        ◦ This means a new event in Easy Opus will automatically appear across all synced calendars, ensuring consistency.
    3. Unified Calendar View:
        ◦ The Easy Opus calendar view integrates the native events with Google, Office 365, and Apple Calendar events to give the user a unified view within the app.

Workflow 4: Apple Calendar (iCal) Integration
User Workflow for Syncing Events with Apple Calendar (iCal)
    1. iCal Subscription:
        ◦ The user enables Apple Calendar sync within Easy Opus. Apple Calendar (iCal) sync may require a webcal link for iCal subscriptions, which is provided by Easy Opus for one-way syncing from Easy Opus to Apple Calendar.
    2. Event Sync:
        ◦ One-Way Sync (iCal): If using iCal links, any event created or updated in Easy Opus is shared with Apple Calendar via the webcal link, allowing iCal to pull and display Easy Opus events.
        ◦ Two-Way Sync (API): For full integration, Easy Opus uses the EventKit framework on iOS devices (if Apple allows direct access) to manage two-way sync for Apple Calendar. This enables Easy Opus to both read and write events to Apple Calendar.
    3. Unified View:
        ◦ Apple Calendar events are integrated into the Easy Opus app’s unified view, alongside Google and Office 365 events, giving users a single view of all their schedules.

Workflow Summary: Unified View of All Calendars
    1. Initial Setup:
        ◦ The user authorizes each third-party calendar individually (Google, Office 365, and Apple), and Easy Opus establishes secure access tokens for each integration.
        ◦ Each calendar syncs its events with Easy Opus’s native calendar, providing a consolidated view.
    2. Two-Way Syncing:
        ◦ For Google Calendar and Office 365, two-way syncing ensures changes made in Easy Opus are reflected in the external calendars, and vice versa.
        ◦ For Apple Calendar, syncing may be one-way (using webcal links) or two-way if iOS permissions allow full EventKit access.
    3. Unified Display and Management:
        ◦ Easy Opus collects events from all connected calendars and displays them in a single, consolidated calendar view. This unified view enables users to manage and view events from multiple sources within the Easy Opus app.
    4. Conflict Management:
        ◦ Easy Opus tracks the last update timestamps and unique identifiers from each external calendar to prevent duplicate events and handle any conflicts between calendar services, ensuring data integrity across all synced platforms.

These workflows allow Easy Opus to provide a seamless calendar experience by integrating external calendar services while maintaining its own calendar and syncing everything to a single interface. This unified approach not only saves time for users but also ensures that their scheduling information remains consistent across all platforms.
       SMS Integration and Calender Management via SMS
To send calendar requests directly to a mobile number, you have a few potential approaches. Here’s an outline of how this could be implemented with existing protocols and services:
1. SMS as a Notification Medium
    • Calendar Invitations via SMS: While SMS itself doesn't natively support calendar events, it can act as a medium for delivering a link to an event or calendar invite that the recipient can open and add to their calendar app.
    • Workflow:
        1. When a calendar invite is created on Google, Office 365, Apple, or your own Easy Opus calendar, an SMS gateway service (like Twilio or Nexmo) could send an SMS with a link to an .ics file.
        2. The recipient receives an SMS with a link. When they click it, the event opens in the default calendar app on their device, allowing them to save it to their calendar.
    • Pros: Simple, widely compatible, and uses standard SMS protocols.
    • Cons: Requires an internet connection to download and open the .ics link; doesn’t directly integrate with calendar protocols but serves as an efficient workaround.
2. Email to SMS Gateway
    • Emailing Calendar Invites to SMS: Some providers have an “email-to-SMS” service, where sending an email to a special address converts it to an SMS for the recipient’s phone.
    • Workflow:
        1. A calendar invite is generated as an email with an .ics file attachment.
        2. This email is sent to a service that converts the email into an SMS. For example, with certain providers, sending an email to number@carrier-sms-gateway.com (like 1234567890@txt.att.net for AT&T in the U.S.) will forward it to that phone number as an SMS.
    • Pros: Simple integration with email-based calendar services.
    • Cons: Requires knowledge of the user’s carrier and has size limitations, as not all carriers support attachments.
3. USSD (Unstructured Supplementary Service Data)
    • Direct Interaction with Calendar Events: USSD allows interaction between a mobile device and an application on the network. While commonly used for simple mobile banking and service requests, it can also be leveraged to provide calendar event details.
    • Workflow:
        1. A USSD short code (like *123#) could prompt the user to see details of a calendar event.
        2. The user could interact via numeric responses to accept or reject invitations, get event times, or see calendar details.
    • Pros: Works without internet and doesn’t depend on the phone’s OS, only on GSM network compatibility.
    • Cons: USSD messages are session-based and don’t offer a persistent link to a calendar event. This method is limited in user experience and may require specialized telecom support.
4. RCS (Rich Communication Services) for Advanced Messaging
    • RCS for Enhanced Event Invites: RCS, the next-gen SMS, offers rich features like media sharing, read receipts, and more, making it closer to app messaging. If supported by the recipient's network and device, RCS could deliver calendar invites more interactively.
    • Workflow:
        1. Send an RCS message with a calendar link or event details.
        2. The recipient receives an enhanced message (if they have RCS) that includes actionable options like “Accept” or “Decline.”
    • Pros: Offers a richer user experience than SMS, potentially including interactivity like direct RSVP.
    • Cons: RCS support varies by carrier and device, limiting its reach.
5. Direct Integration with Messaging Apps (e.g., WhatsApp Business API, Telegram)
    • Push Calendar Invites via Messaging Apps: With the growing adoption of messaging apps, sending calendar invites or notifications through platforms like WhatsApp or Telegram could work, leveraging their APIs.
    • Workflow:
        1. A calendar invite is created and then sent through the messaging app as a link or an event.
        2. The recipient taps the link, which opens the event in their calendar app, allowing them to save it.
    • Pros: Delivers event invites in a widely used app, making it easier to reach users and track message delivery.
    • Cons: Requires opt-in, and message limits may apply. Would also need to verify the user has the messaging app installed.
Recommended Approach
If the goal is to work with existing protocols and reach a broad audience, using SMS with a link to an .ics file or email-to-SMS gateway would be most straightforward. This approach leverages simple tools that work across devices and don’t require additional infrastructure.
For users with RCS-enabled devices, combining SMS and RCS would offer an enhanced experience without additional setup. For specific regions or advanced users, a messaging app like WhatsApp could be a good supplemental option for enhanced interaction.
These methods would allow recipients to receive calendar invites through familiar, accessible protocols on their mobile devices.
